Title: Prepare Raster for Grammar of Graphics Plot
Version: 0.0.1
Authors@R: person("Michael D.", "Sumner", email = "mdsumner@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Prepare raster data for use in 'ggplot2'.  The general form in Grammar of Graphics
 is to expand a raster into a full 'xyz' data frame, but there is an annotation mechanism that works
 fast and avoids this. Functions here simply prepare data for this annotation workflow.
